# NavigationFlowConcept
Concept of navigation controllers in an iOS app. Based on the articles:
- http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/
- http://merowing.info/2016/01/improve-your-ios-architecture-with-flowcontrollers/

## Features

- [x] Works with factories to prepare viewControllers with there dependencies injected.
- [x] This way viewControllers will get decoupled, to get inversion of control.
- [x] Doesn't work with states, as I don't see any real benefit from it (for now).

## Requirements

- Swift 4.0
